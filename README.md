# Vesper: Cybersecurity & Cryptography Practice Suite

This project is a Python-based suite for practicing and demonstrating skills in password cracking, hashing algorithms, classic ciphers, and related cybersecurity concepts. It is designed for learning, portfolio building, and showcasing abilities for cybersecurity job applications.

## Features (Planned)
- Password hashing and verification utilities
- Brute-force and dictionary attack modules
- Classic ciphers (Caesar, Vigen√®re, etc.)
- Hash/crack utilities
- Modular, well-documented code

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
